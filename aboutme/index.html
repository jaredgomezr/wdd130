<p>TCP/IP = Transmition Control Protocol / Internet Protocol
    HTTP = Hypoer Text Transfer Protocol
Web user =front end osea yo, web server = backend osea google, safari etc
URL =Uniform Resource Locator or web address 
DNS = Domain Name System
HTML and CSS are front end and Python or PHP are back-end 
</p>
<body style="background-color:mediumorchid" ></body>
<p>HTML is not key sensitive but is good practive to leave it in lower case 
HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language
H1=Heading level one tag
H2=SubHeading'one level down the H1 
P=paragraph
Hypertext refers to the way we can place
hypertext links in our document that allows our users to move from one page to another.
Markup is a set of symbols or codes for displaying content on the Internet. It’s not a
programming language, it’s a markup language that tells web browsers (like Chrome, Safari, or
Edge) the structure of a web page's words and images. This markup language includes the tags
we make to code around the content, then the browser will use this code to display or render
our pages correctly </p>

<body> 
<p> Other elements
Body= anything that is inside of the page
 header=will show up on the upper part of the web, will not disappear like the companies logo etc
main=are the unique elements that could change form ne page to other when click differnet parts of the web
footer= will show up everything on the lower part, like the header, this will remain even if you visit different parts of the page 
nav= goes between the header element and is use to hold the menu and define link and contain 
semantics tags 'h1' is the header 'a' is a link 'img'is an image 
HTML is just the body of the page, just the structure
</p>

<p>CSS is a language to give color and personalized the HTML, give it presentation
CSS= Cascading Style Sheet
we can give colors in 2 ways - we open the greather-than and lower-than brackets and then type the following code 
body style="background-color: chartreuse" ..  this will give us the color however we avoid to do it inline CSS as make hard to edit later,
-we can do it in this way as well on the head part  where you see the · means greather and lower than symbols
·title·CSS style·/title·
·style·
    body{
        background-color: thecoloryouwant;
    }
Again, this is also not the preferred way because you can’t reuse your CSS on multiple pages of your website
instead of that we will do a different CSS file with all our formats, so we create our library and it´s easier to change in the future
and then we can put it in different webpages with this code inside of the head banner....... ·link rel="stylesheet" href = "style.css"·
</p>

<p> This is the end </p>
